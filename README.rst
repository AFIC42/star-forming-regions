SF3dmodels is a star forming region(s) modelling package that brings together
analytical models in order to compute their physical properties in a 3D grid. The
package can couple different models in a single grid to recreate complex star
forming systems as those being revealed by current instruments. 
The output data can be read with `LIME <https://lime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ 
or `RADMC-3D <http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/>`_ 
to carry out radiative transfer calculations.
