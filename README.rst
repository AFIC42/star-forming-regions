SF3dmodels is a star-forming-region(s) modelling package that brings together
analytical pmodels in order to compute physical properties in a 3D grid. The
package can couple different models in a single grid to recreate complex star
forming systems as those being revealed by current telescopes and
interferometersrs. The output data is compatible with LIME or RADMC-3D in order
to perform radiative transfer calculations.
